Q. Explain Time and Space Complexity with examples.
=> Time Complexity:
   Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm.
   Example:
    Consider a simple loop that runs 'n' times:
    ```
    function printNumbers(n) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
    ```
    The time complexity of this function is O(n) because the loop runs 'n' times, and the time taken grows linearly with the input size.
=> Space Complexity:
   Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. It helps in analyzing the memory efficiency of an algorithm.
   Example:
    Consider a function that creates an array of size 'n':
    ```
    function createArray(n) {
        let arr = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr.push(i);
        }
        return arr;
    }
    ```
    The space complexity of this function is O(n) because it creates an array that grows linearly with the input size.
